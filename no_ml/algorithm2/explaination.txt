This document explains the reasoning behind the second traceroute algorithm...

Parsing the traceroute data:
- The traceroute data is parsed exactly as it is in the first traceroute algorithm
- the last 5 ip addresses are recoreded, ignoring the last byte of data

Training of traceroute data:
- Every occurance of a new traceroute is included in the training dataset.
    This algorithm does not protect against outliers in trained set of traceroutes,
    however the hope would be that it can catch a move before enough data would 
    be collected to have a false ip address be included in the training set

Testing of traceroute data:
- Each traceroute is tested against the training set. If there are two or more ip
    addresses in the test traceroue in a single one of the trained traceroutes, the 
    test passes. 90% of the traceroutes must have passed for it to be determined 
    that the device has not moved.

Notes:
- From what I have seen this protects against everything. I am getting 100% accurate
    data as long as the two ip addresses are not in a similar geographical location
- I am struggling to see why this would be though..
